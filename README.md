# Multi-Seasonal-Time-Series
Repository for my attempt in TS competition held by Data Analythics Vidhya

This project is based on an active hackathon from [Analytics Vidhya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-time-series-2/#About). They actively organize lots of different data analytics competition freely, thanks to them i can practice my time series forecasting knowledge. Lets imagine we’re a data analyst hired by the company we talk before. In order to the company in their decision, we need to forecast the traffic on JetRail for the next 7 months. We are provided with traffic data of JetRail since inception in the test file. We’ll try to build best forecasting self-evaluation using cross validation technique and also evaluated from the competition website by submitting our forecast.
